# Data science projects

- **WaiDatathon 2021 ðŸ¥‡** ([blogpost](https://abauville.github.io/blog/supervised%20learning/eda/competition/2021/04/21/wai-datathon.html), [repository](https://github.com/abauville/wai_hackathon_2021)): I led the team to victory in the WaiDatathon 2021 on the theme "Combat domestic violence with data and AI". We presented an exploratory data analysis and a method to produce personalized domestic violence detection questionnaires based on a classification tree.

# Scientific simulation software

- [**Sunaba**](https://github.com/abauville/Sunaba): 2D simulation of geodynamical thermomechanical processes based on the finite difference method. Written in C, Python and OpenGL.
- [**geomIO**](https://geomio.bitbucket.io/): 3D geometric modeling from serial 2D drawings. Used to initialize numerical simulations. Written in MATLAB.
- [**CriticalTaper-utils**](https://github.com/abauville/CriticalTaper-utils): Python scripts to compute and visualize the solutions of the critical taper theory.
- [**FortyTwoFEM**](https://github.com/abauville/FortyTwoFEM): A fluid mechanics solver based on the finite element method. Written in Matlab.
- [**SPH_solver**](https://github.com/abauville/SPH_python_solver): a fluid dynamics solver based on the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Written in Python and optimized with Numba.
