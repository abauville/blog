# Get the most out of Datacamp

- Datacamp has many qualities (describe)
- But it also has inconvenients
    - very guided: each exercise sees you only filling the blanks
    - you can never submit an original idea, or a different way of obtaining the same result
    - even if you experiment with the code the result of your experiment just stays there
    - there is no search engine to find relevant pieces of information, you would have to go back to the course and go over the course slides (without the transcript) in the hope of finding the info or the piece of code you're looking for
- As a consequence, you might not get the most out of it. You could validate some course even if you don't really understand it or, even if you understand it, the skill might not be well consolidated and when faced with the task of applying that knowledge months later you would be unable to do it and unable to retrieve the information (/!\ repetition).

After a couple of months I realized these shortcomings and I tried several methods to get more out of it. Here's what I tried:

- take notes in a paper notebook
- study the math behind every presented technique (and taking notes)
- reproduce the exercises in my own Jupyter notebook
- writing blog posts
- creating projects
- apply the techniques learned to a different dataset
- implement techniques from scratch
