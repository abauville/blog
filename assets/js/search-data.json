Problem description . The WaiDatathon 2021 was organized by Women in AI on the theme &quot;Combat Domestic Violence with Data &amp; AI&quot;. This notebook reproduces our main analysis for which we earned the first place at the competition. . Many professionals including social workers, medical professionals, academics, politicians or police agents are working daily to help women in abusive relationships, raise awareness in the general public and overall fight this phenomenon. Despite their efforts domestic violence is still a critical but hidden problem all around the world. When approaching this challenge it was clear for us that no amount of machine learning would solve the problem. Domestic violence is a sensitive and emotional topic for the victims. One of machine learning greatest strength is its ability to automate complex tasks, but domestic violence is a deeply human problem, and we believe that humans are the most important part of the support mechanism. . Three human parties are involved in domestic violence: the victim, the abuser and the supporters. We approached the challenge in two parts. Firstly, we addressed the victim&#39;s point of view. In particular, we tried to understand the relationships between the attitudes toward domestic and its occurence, and how these are affected by demographic characteristics. Secondly, we tried to provide an additional tools to supporters in order to detect women in danger. For this purpose we proposed a machine learning model that creates a questionnaire to detect early signs of domestic violence. Because the model can be deployed on paper or by dialogue, it is especially suited for developing countries. . You can watch our 5-minute competition talk here. . . 1. Dataset description . Our analysis is based on the amazing data from The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program. This DHS program&#39;s goal is to collect, analyze and disseminate accurate and representative data on population, health, HIV and nutrition. It has run more than 400 surveys in 90 countries. . The dataset provided competition contains the results to the acceptability question (see below) aggregated per demographics (e.g. age, education, location). In other terms, this dataset contains information such as &quot;70% of respondents with a secondary level of education answered &#39;yes&#39; to a given question&quot;. However, since it does not contain the demographic information and answers of individual respondents it was not possible to cross mutliple information (e.g. age and education) or to build a predictive model. . To overcome this difficulty we obtained the complete DHS survey&#39;s women&#39;s questionnaire for Sub-Saharan countries. This dataset contains the response of individual respondents (samples) to thousands of questions (features). For a given country and a given survey phase the dataset would contain in the order of 10,000 samples and 4200 features. However, due to time constraints and the necessity to clean the data we did not use all the features but selected a subset of 38 questions. . For the competition we used data of the DHS survey for Benin and Congo, but to comply with copyright requirements of the DHS program only the example data of the DHS survey or generated by STATcompiler are contained in this github repository. Access to more data is free upon request on the DHS website. This notebook can be used to treat any survey data from the DHS women&#39;s questionnaire. However, since the survey questions are revised from one phase to another, some adjustements might be required in the data cleaning process when using earlier phases. . Some of the most important features for our analysis were in the form of multiple short questions on a given theme. We treated these questions either as: . individual features | a sum of positive answer (for a given theme) | a boolean value (True if any question on a theme was answered true, False otherwise) | . Below, we list these questions with their possible answers. . Important questions . Acceptability of violence: . Feature names: v744a - v744f Possible answers: . 0 No | 1 Yes | 8 Don&#39;t know | (m) 9 Missing | (na) Not applicable | . In your opinion, is a husband justified in hitting or beating his wife when: . she goes out without telling him? | she neglects the children? | she argues with him? | she refuses to have sex with him? | . marital control behaviors: . Feature name: d101a - d101e Possible answers: see previous .

Physical violence: . Feature names: d105a - d105k Possible answers: . 0 Never | 1 Often | 2 Sometimes | 3 Yes, but not in the last 12 months | 4 Yes, but frequency in last 12 months missing | (m) 9 Missing | (na) Not applicable | . Have you even been: . pushed, shook or had something thrown by husband/partner? | slapped by husband/partner? | punched with fist or hit by something harmful by husband/partner? | kicked or dragged by husband/partner? | strangled or burnt by husband/partner? | threatened with knife/gun or other weapon by husband/partner? | physically forced into unwanted sex by husband/partner? | forced into other unwanted sexual acts by husband/partner? | had arm twisted or hair pulled by husband/partner? | physically forced to perform sexual acts respondent didn&#39;t want to? | . Emotional violence: . Feature names: d103a - d103c Possible answers: see previous . Have you ever benn: . humiliated by husband/partner? | threatened with harm by husband/partner? | insulted or made to feel bad by husband/partner? | . . 2. Setup . First we import libraries, customize figure output and load the data. . # Import libraries import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib as mpl import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns import plotly.express as px import plotly.graph_objects as go # Customize figure output plt.style.use(&#39;seaborn&#39;) mpl.rc(&#39;font&#39;, size=18) mpl.rc(&#39;axes&#39;, labelsize=&#39;large&#39;) mpl.rc(&#39;xtick&#39;, labelsize=&#39;large&#39;) mpl.rc(&#39;ytick&#39;, labelsize=&#39;large&#39;) plt.rcParams[&#39;figure.figsize&#39;] = [20, 10] # For larger plots . . . 3. Acceptability vs experience of domestic violence . df = pd.read_csv(&#39;./Data/DHS_summary_world.csv&#39;, skiprows=1, skipfooter=11,engine=&#39;python&#39;) df = df.merge(pd.read_csv(&#39;./Data/iso_alpha_list.csv&#39;), left_on=&#39;Country&#39;, right_on=&#39;country&#39;,how=&#39;left&#39;) # Sample only the most recent survey for each country country_list = df[&#39;Country&#39;].unique().tolist() temp = [df[df[&#39;Country&#39;]==country].reset_index().iloc[0] for country in country_list] df = pd.DataFrame(temp).reset_index().drop(columns=[&#39;level_0&#39;,&#39;index&#39;]) . .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
