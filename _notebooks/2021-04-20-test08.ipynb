    "The WaiDatathon 2021 was organized by Women in AI on the theme [\"Combat Domestic Violence with Data & AI\"](https://www.womeninai.co/waidatathon-details). This notebook reproduces our main analysis for which we earned the first place at the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many professionals including social workers, medical professionals, academics, politicians or police agents are working daily to help women in abusive relationships, raise awareness in the general public and overall fight this phenomenon. Despite their efforts domestic violence is still a critical but hidden problem all around the world. When approaching this challenge it was clear for us that no amount of machine learning would solve the problem. Domestic violence is a sensitive and emotional topic for the victims. One of machine learning greatest strength is its ability to automate complex tasks, but domestic violence is a deeply human problem, and we believe that humans are the most important part of the support mechanism. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three human parties are involved in domestic violence: the victim, the abuser and the supporters. We approached the challenge in two parts. Firstly, we addressed the victim's point of view. In particular, we tried to understand the relationships between the attitudes toward domestic and its occurence, and how these are affected by demographic characteristics. Secondly, we tried to provide an additional tools to supporters in order to detect women in danger. For this purpose we proposed a machine learning model that creates a questionnaire to detect early signs of domestic violence. Because the model can be deployed on paper or by dialogue, it is especially suited for developing countries. \n",

    "\n",
    "Our analysis is based on the amazing data from [The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program](https://www.google.com). This DHS program's goal is to collect, analyze and disseminate accurate and representative data on population, health, HIV and nutrition. It has run more than 400 surveys in 90 countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [dataset provided competition](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w10/workspace/file?filename=20200306+Data+International+Women%27s+Day+Viz5+Launch.csv) contains the results to the **acceptability question** (see below) aggregated per demographics (e.g. age, education, location). In other terms, this dataset contains information such as \"70% of respondents with a secondary level of education answered 'yes' to a given question\". However, since it does not contain the demographic information and answers of individual respondents it was not possible to cross mutliple information (e.g. age and education) or to build a predictive model. \n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this difficulty we obtained the complete DHS survey's [women's questionnaire](https://dhsprogram.com/Methodology/Survey-Types/DHS-Questionnaires.cfm#CP_JUMP_16179) for Sub-Saharan countries. This dataset contains the response of individual respondents (samples) to thousands of questions (features). For a given country and a given survey phase the dataset would contain in the order of 10,000 samples and 4200 features. However, due to time constraints and the necessity to clean the data we did not use all the features but selected a subset of 38 questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the competition we used data of the DHS survey for Benin and Congo, but to comply with copyright requirements of the DHS program only the example data of the DHS survey or generated by [STATcompiler](https://www.statcompiler.com/) are contained in this github repository. Access to more data is free upon request on the [DHS website](https://dhsprogram.com/data/Using-Datasets-for-Analysis.cfm). This notebook can be used to treat any survey data from the DHS women's questionnaire. However, since the survey questions are revised from one phase to another, some adjustements might be required in the data cleaning process when using earlier phases.\n",
